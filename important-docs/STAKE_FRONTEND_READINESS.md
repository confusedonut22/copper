# Stake Frontend Readiness

This document tracks the current frontend submission blockers for
[game](game).

## confirmed

- The frontend builds to static files with Vite/Svelte.
- The imported frontend source now includes a split action path in the runtime/store layer.
- Current frontend tests are green, including a settlement regression that verifies split-created 21 is resolved as a normal win rather than a natural blackjack.
- The app now parses Stake-style launch params:
  - `sessionID`
  - `lang`
  - `device`
  - `rgs_url`
  - `replay`
  - `game`
  - `version`
  - `mode`
  - `event`
- The frontend now uses `sessionID` and `rgs_url` for an `Authenticate` bootstrap scaffold.
- The frontend can also refresh the authenticated balance through the official `wallet/balance` path when the window regains focus.
- Authenticated balance and bet-config values can now seed the prototype stores.
- Authenticated currency can now drive balance and wager display instead of assuming USD-only output.
- Main bet selection can now respect authenticated bet levels when config provides them.
- Side-bet selection can now also respect authenticated side-bet config when provided.
- The frontend now emits Stake-style `Play`, `Event`, and `EndRound` client calls during round flow.
- Frontend round handling now normalizes the official Stake `round` shape around:
  - `betID`
  - `active`
  - `mode`
  - `event`
  - `state`
- Frontend `Event` payloads are now emitted as sequenced JSON strings keyed to the active `betID`.
- Frontend `Event` payloads now also attach a draft blackjack state snapshot so interrupted hands have a repo-local resume shape to build on.
- Frontend `EndRound` now aligns more closely with the official client shape by closing the round without inventing extra request payload fields.
- Jurisdiction flags from authenticate are now normalized in the frontend, with:
  - autoplay hidden/disabled when `disabledAutoplay` is true
  - RTP disclosure hidden when `displayRTP` is false
  - session timer shown when `displaySessionTimer` is true
  - net position shown when `displayNetPosition` is true
- If authenticate returns an active round with a hydratable `round.state`, the frontend can now restore that hand locally instead of always blocking resume.
- Replay bootstrap can now fetch a completed round from the official-style `GET /bet/replay/{game}/{version}/{mode}/{event}` route and hydrate the replay state locally, even without a sessionID.
- Replay fetch now tolerates both nested `round.state` payloads and top-level official replay `state` payloads.
- Replay hydration now preserves split-hand metadata needed to keep no-DAS and split-ace restrictions intact after restore.
- Local launch can now fall back to Vite env defaults for `sessionID` and `rgs_url`, while still allowing Stake-style query params to override them.
- The static build now uses relative asset paths, which is safer for CDN subpath hosting instead of assuming a domain-root `/assets` path.
- Button legality for split hands now correctly blocks double-after-split by default
- Font assets are bundled locally (no external resource loading)

## confirmed blockers

- Split is now functional with DAS=false (double-after-split blocked by default); the remaining frontend blocker is not split legality but external backend/replay contract confirmation.
- The mock RGS can now own round creation, actions, replay fetch, and persisted active-round state, but it is still a local scaffold rather than a real Stake-integrated backend.
- Resume only works when the returned `round.state` matches the current repo-local draft snapshot shape.
- Replay mode is materially stronger, but reviewer expectations for blackjack-specific replay edge cases still need final external validation.
- The app still hydrates a repo-local blackjack snapshot contract rather than a formally Stake-confirmed blackjack contract.

## open question

- For blackjack, replay likely needs the full hand decision sequence:
  - initial deal
  - side-bet resolution
  - insurance choice
  - hit/stand/double decisions
  - dealer draw sequence
  - final settlement
- A whole blackjack hand sequence is likely the correct replay unit, but the public docs remain slot-heavy.

## next repo-safe steps

1. Replace the local mock RGS with a real service boundary that owns wallet/session authority beyond local JSON scaffolding.
2. Freeze the final backend-owned blackjack round-resume strategy for active rounds returned by authenticate, including the exact `round.state` contract.
3. Decide how side bets and insurance map into authenticated Stake config and round lifecycle.
4. Confirm blackjack-specific replay expectations with Stake if reviewer guidance is needed beyond the public docs.
